The contents of this repository come from my dissertation that was submitted for the degree of BEng with Honours in Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Newcastle University (UK) on 05/2020.

The dissertation was rated at 79% and was the main factor why I have received first class degree.

Contents included:

1. The dissertation PDF file itself
2. Object detection using background subtraction technique
3. Detected object tracking using Kalman filter
4. Detected object tracking using Particle filter

Videos used for the object tracking can be found here: http://jacarini.dinf.usherbrooke.ca/dataset2014/

What will you need:

1. A video file
2. Python 3 (Version 3.8 was used, earlier versions probably will work as well)
3. OpenCV (Version 4.2.0 was used, earlier versions probably will work as well)
4. NumPy (Version 1.18 was used, earlier versions probably will work as well)
5. Matplotlib was used, but only for plotting graphs for the dissertation, not required in the actual code
